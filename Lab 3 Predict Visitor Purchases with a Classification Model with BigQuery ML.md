# Predict Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model with BigQuery ML

These are notes taken as part of the course " Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals" And was practiced with Qwiklabs.
In this lab we peform the following 
1. Use BigQuery to find public datasets
2. Query and explore the ecommerce dataset
3. Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
4. Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BQML
5. Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
6. Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase
