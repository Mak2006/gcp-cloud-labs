# Predict Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model with BigQuery ML

These are notes taken as part of the course " Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals" And was practiced with Qwiklabs.
 
 [BigQuery Machine Learning](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigqueryml-analyst-start) (BQML, product in beta) is a new feature in BigQuery where data analysts can create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.

Scenario, you have a data set loaded and we use BigQuery to get some insights. This is plain SQL. 

### Query and explore the ecommerce dataset
```

```
3. Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
4. Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BQML
5. Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
6. Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase
