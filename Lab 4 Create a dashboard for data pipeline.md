# Create a Streaming Data Pipeline for a Real-Time Dashboard with Cloud Dataflow

### Business Requirment 
In this lab, you own a fleet of New York City taxi cabs and are looking to monitor how well your business is doing in real-time. You will build a streaming data pipeline to capture taxi revenue, passenger count, ride status, and much more and visualize the results in a management dashboard.
