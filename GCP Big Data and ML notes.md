# GCP Big data and ML 
Notes from the GCP Big data and ML course

1. We spin a vm, do the calculation get the final artifact and store it on the storage.
2. In the cloud world - a way of thinking is storage is separated from compute. Both have different costs and serve different needs.
3. GCP projects is logical grouping, while zones etc are physical aspects.

## Cost optimization tips
3.  **VM** - stop the vm, and pay only for disks attached. VM running cost is more than disk attached cost.
