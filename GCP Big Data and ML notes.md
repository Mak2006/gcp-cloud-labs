# GCP Big data and ML 
Notes from the GCP Big data and ML course

1. We spin a vm, do the calculation get the final artifact and store it on the storage.
2. In the cloud world - a way of thinking is storage is separated from compute. Both have different costs and serve different needs.
3. GCP projects is logical grouping, while zones etc are physical aspects.
4. GCP comes with Jupyter network. Very high performance network. This makes it possible to have compute wholly separated from storage.

## Cost optimization tips
3.  **VM** - stop the vm, and pay only for disks attached. VM running cost is more than disk attached cost.
