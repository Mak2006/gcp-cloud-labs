# Lab 2 - Recommend Products using ML with Cloud SQL and Dataproc
These are notes taken as part of the course " Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals" And was practiced with Qwiklabs.

Here, we use Cloud SQL to store the data for the recommendation engine built on 	Spark ML. 

## Create a Cloud SQL instance
## Create tables, view data
## Data sourcing and load in to C SQL
## View the data
## Launch Dataproc
Select region
Enable API
