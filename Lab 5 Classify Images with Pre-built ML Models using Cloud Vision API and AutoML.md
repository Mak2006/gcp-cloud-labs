## Classify Images with Pre-built ML Models using Cloud Vision API and AutoML

**Business Driver**
In this lab, you will experiment with pre-built models so there's no coding. First we'll start with the pre-trained Vision API where we don't need to bring our own data and then we'll progress into AutoML for more sophisticated custom labelling that we need.
