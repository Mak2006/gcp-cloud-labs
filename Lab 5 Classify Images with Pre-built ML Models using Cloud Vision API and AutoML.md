## Classify Images with Pre-built ML Models using Cloud Vision API and AutoML

**Business Driver**
Overview - In this lab, you will experiment with pre-built models so there's no coding. First we'll start with the pre-trained Vision API where we don't need to bring our own data and then we'll progress into AutoML for more sophisticated custom labelling that we need.

Functional - In this lab you will upload images to Cloud Storage and use them to train a custom model to recognize different types of clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, etc.). Then try to classify new images based on what is learnt. 

**Load >> Train >> Predict**
This is the algo we follow.


 


Quite a big lab!! undestandable duet to AutoML init
