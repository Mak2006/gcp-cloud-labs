# Use BigQuery to explore a public data set.
This are notes taken as part of the course "## Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals"

GCP has a lot of public data sets available on which we can run BigQuery. In this lab, we shall  load a data set and query on them. 

Using Google BigQuery we can fire traditional SQL on massive data sets. We can programmaticallyuse this and also a variety of [third-party tools](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/third-party-tools) that we can use to interact with BigQuery, such as visualizing the data or loading the data. In this lab, we access BigQuery using the web UI.

## Choose and select a data set

## View a data set

## Create a query and run it
